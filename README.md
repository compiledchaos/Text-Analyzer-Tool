# Text Analyzer Tool

This project is a simple text analysis tool built in Python for learning purposes. It uses the NLTK & Matplotlib libraries to tokenize text, count word frequencies, identify the top 10 most frequent words in a text file, and creates a graph displaying the top 50 most frequent words.

## Features

- Tokenizes text and removes punctuation
- Counts the frequency of each word
- Finds and saves the top 10 most frequent words
- Outputs results to text files
- Displays top 50 most frequent words as a bar graph

## How to Use

1. Place the text file you want to analyze in the project directory.
2. Run the notebook or script.
3. The tool will generate:
   - `word_frequency`: All word frequencies
   - `top_words`: The top 10 most frequent words
   - `analyzed_text`: A summary of the analysis
   - `Graph.png`: The top 50 most frequent words as a graph

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- NLTK
- Matplotlib

Install NLTK with:

```
pip install nltk
```

Install Matplotlib with:

```
pip install matplotlib
```

## Purpose

This project is for practicing Python programming and basic Natural Language Processing (NLP) concepts.
