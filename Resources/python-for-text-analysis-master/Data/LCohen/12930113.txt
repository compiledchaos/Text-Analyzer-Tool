And then you heard, on Remembrance Day, of the Poet who had gone away; No more music in the dark to keep you warm.<p>For years to come you will recall the music&#x27;s death, the soldier&#x27;s fall, and your songs salute them both. So: Hallelujah!<p>Hallelujah! Hallelujah! Hallelujah! Hallelujah!<p>--<p>The first Cohen song that I ever heard was &quot;Everybody Knows&quot;, in <i>Pump Up the Volume</i>.
