I believe we recently discussed Mr. Cohen: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=12700141" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=12700141</a><p>I have cried more tears listening to Leonard Cohen than all the other tears I&#x27;ve cried combined, his music, his words, his poems have always resonated deeply within me. He truly is my favourite artist. We listened to him daily in my dad&#x27;s house and I grew to find an incredibly amount of peace in his voice. Love the HN community seems to like him as much. rest well sir.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=4MXOuaZuTak" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=4MXOuaZuTak</a>
