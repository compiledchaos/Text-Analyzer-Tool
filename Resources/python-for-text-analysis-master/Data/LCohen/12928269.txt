So sad. I saw him in Manhattan. My wife got tickets as a Christmas present, knowing I had been excited when we were traveling in Barcelona and he was there that week. (Couldn&#x27;t get tickets -- didn&#x27;t even try.) So we showed up at Madison Square Garden and I had no idea what we were seeing -- and there were no markings to give away the surprise! It was not until the show started that I knew it was a Leonard Cohen concert. It was an awesome evening.<p><pre><code> If you want a lover I&#x27;ll do anything you ask me to And if you want another kind of love I&#x27;ll wear a mask for you If you want a partner, take my hand, or If you want to strike me down in anger Here I stand I&#x27;m your man</code></pre>
