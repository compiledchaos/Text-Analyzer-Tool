# Basic project structure

* A `README.md` file, with instructions on how to use your scripts.
* A license for your project. See [choose a license](http://choosealicense.com/)
to figure out which one is relevant for your project.
* A folder for the resources you're using.
* A folder for tests (if applicable).
* If you have only one Python file, you can keep it in the root directory. If you
have multiple .py files, put them in a separate folder.
* If you have a large project, consider putting a README file in the subdirectories as well,
explaining how each folder is organized and what is in there.
