We hope that these examples are helpful to set up your own demonstration website,
if you ever need to do so.

## A personal history (Emiel)

I started using Flask a couple of years ago with [this tutorial](https://github.com/bev-a-tron/MyFlaskTutorial).
Now I regularly use Flask to create my own custom annotation tools, or to make a
quick demo for a finished project. Some examples:

* [Annotation tool for the Flickr30K corpus](https://github.com/evanmiltenburg/Flickr30k-Image-Viewer)
* [Annotation tool to classify a set of sentences](https://github.com/evanmiltenburg/annotating-negations)
* [A search tool for the VU sound corpus](https://github.com/evanmiltenburg/SoundBrowser)
