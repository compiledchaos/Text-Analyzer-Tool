    "In this notebook, we focus on sentiment analysis, which is the task of determining whether a text expresses a negative, neutral, or positive opinion. We introduce how to work with [VADER](https://github.com/cjhutto/vaderSentiment) as part of the NLTK to perform sentiment analysis. Given a sentence, e.g., \"I like Python\", VADER will predict a sentiment score on a scale from -1 to 1. The goal of this notebook is to show you how to work with VADER. One of the learning goals of the accompanying assignment is to gain insight into VADER by reading blogs about the system.\n",

    "### at the end of this notebook, you will:\n",
    "* have VADER installed on your computer\n",
    "* be able to load the VADER model\n",
    "* be able to apply the VADER model on new sentences:\n",
    "    * with and without lemmatization\n",
    "    * with providing VADER with certain parts of speech, e.g., providing the adjectives from a sentence as input to VADER\n",
